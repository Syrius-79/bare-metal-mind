## Bare Metal Mind

Nobody reads this.

Good.

I don’t write for applause.
I write because I push machines until they complain.

I don’t rent intelligence.
I don’t trust “AI platforms”.
I don’t believe in dashboards with rounded corners.

I believe in heat.
In silicon.
In VRAM limits.
In context windows that almost crash the system.

I build local.
I break local.
I fix local.

Cloud AI is convenience.
Bare metal is control.

when hardware is actually driven —

this is where it’s documented.

Unfiltered.
Unoptimized.
Unapologetic.
