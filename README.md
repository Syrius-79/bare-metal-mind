BARE METAL MIND

Most people don’t run powerful LLMs.

They run confused ones.

They increase temperature.
They copy prompts.
They blame the model.

Then they say:
“LLMs are overrated.”

No.

You just never controlled it.

This repository is not about hype.

It is about:

running local models

understanding drift

forcing behavioral stability

pushing context until it breaks

proving what “uncensored” actually means

Everything here was tested on real hardware.

No screenshots.
No theory.
No LinkedIn AI nonsense.

If you want magic prompts,
leave.

If you want to understand why models fracture under pressure,
keep reading.
